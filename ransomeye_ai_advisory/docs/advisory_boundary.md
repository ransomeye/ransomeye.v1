# Advisory Boundary - Explicit Non-Enforcement Guarantee

**Path and File Name:** `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_ai_advisory/docs/advisory_boundary.md`  
**Author:** nXxBku0CKFAJCBN3X1g3bQk7OxYQylg8CMw1iGsq7gU  
**Details:** Explicit guarantee that AI advisory module does NOT influence enforcement or control planes

## Core Principle

**AI Advisory is advisory-only. It MUST NOT influence policy decisions, trigger enforcement, or modify system state.**

## Non-Enforcement Guarantees

### 1. No Policy Influence
- AI outputs do NOT influence Phase 6 policy engine
- Policy decisions are made independently
- AI confidence scores are advisory only

### 2. No Enforcement Triggers
- AI outputs do NOT trigger Phase 7 dispatcher
- Enforcement directives are generated by Phase 6 only
- AI recommendations are analyst reference only

### 3. No State Modification
- All AI operations are read-only
- No write access to Control Plane
- No write access to Enforcement Plane

## Advisory Outputs Only

### Allowed Outputs
- Confidence scores (advisory)
- Rationale (human-readable explanations)
- Evidence references (read-only)
- Recommended investigation steps (advisory)

### Forbidden Outputs
- Enforcement directives
- Policy modifications
- State changes
- Control plane commands

## Boundary Enforcement

Any attempt to cross the advisory boundary results in:
1. **ABORT** - Operation immediately terminated
2. **AUDIT LOG** - Violation logged with full context
3. **AI DISABLED** - Advisory module disabled until manual re-enable

## Implementation Guarantees

- All AI functions return advisory-only data structures
- No AI function accepts enforcement parameters
- No AI function can modify system state
- All AI outputs are validated before return
