**Path and File Name:** `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_architecture/data_contracts/ai_to_human.md`  
**Author:** nXxBku0CKFAJCBN3X1g3bQk7OxYQylg8CMw1iGsq7gU  
**Details:** Data contract between Intelligence Plane and Human - advisory outputs only

---

## Overview

This contract defines the **one-way data flow** from Intelligence Plane to Human. All outputs are advisory only and require human review.

---

## Contract Properties

### Direction: One-Way

**Rule:** Data flows ONLY from Intelligence Plane → Human

**Enforcement:**
- No reverse flow for enforcement
- No automatic enforcement
- Human review required
- Control Plane validation required

### Trust Level: Advisory → Human Decision

**Rule:** Intelligence Plane is advisory, Human makes decisions

**Enforcement:**
- Advisory outputs only
- No automatic enforcement
- Human review required
- Control Plane validation required

### Advisory: Mandatory Flag

**Rule:** All AI outputs must be marked as advisory

**Enforcement:**
- Advisory flag required
- Advisory flag must be true
- No enforcement authority
- Human review required

---

## Data Format

### Advisory Output

```json
{
  "output_id": "<unique-output-id>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO-8601-timestamp>",
  "component_identity": "<ai-component-identity-hash>",
  "advisory": true,
  "data": {
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "type": "<recommendation-type>",
        "confidence": <confidence-score>,
        "explanation": "<explanation>",
        "shap_values": {}
      }
    ],
    "risk_scores": {},
    "explanations": {},
    "metadata": {}
  },
  "signature": {
    "algorithm": "RSA-4096-PSS-SHA256",
    "signature": "<base64-encoded-signature>",
    "data_hash": "<SHA-256-hash>"
  }
}
```

### Required Fields

- `output_id`: Unique output identifier
- `timestamp`: Output timestamp (ISO-8601)
- `component_identity`: AI component identity hash
- `advisory`: Must be true
- `data`: Advisory recommendations
- `signature`: Cryptographic signature

## Validation Rules

### Rule 1: Advisory Flag

**Check:**
- Advisory flag present
- Advisory flag is true
- No enforcement authority
- Human review required

**Failure:** Reject output, terminate AI component, audit log

### Rule 2: Signature Validation

**Check:**
- Signature present
- Signature format valid
- Signature algorithm valid
- Signature matches data
- Signature matches component identity

**Failure:** Reject output, audit log

### Rule 3: Identity Validation

**Check:**
- Component identity present
- Identity valid
- Identity not revoked
- Identity has required permissions

**Failure:** Reject output, audit log

---

## Human Review Process

### Step 1: Receive Advisory

**Process:**
1. Receive advisory output
2. Verify signature
3. Verify identity
4. Verify advisory flag

### Step 2: Review Advisory

**Process:**
1. Review recommendations
2. Review explanations
3. Review SHAP values
4. Review risk scores

### Step 3: Make Decision

**Process:**
1. Human makes decision
2. Control Plane validates decision
3. Enforcement authorized (if needed)
4. Audit log entry

---

## Forbidden Operations

### Operation 1: Automatic Enforcement

**Rule:** AI cannot automatically enforce recommendations

**Enforcement:**
- No automatic enforcement
- Human review required
- Control Plane validation required
- Enforced at interface level

### Operation 2: Direct Enforcement

**Rule:** AI cannot directly authorize enforcement

**Enforcement:**
- No enforcement APIs accessible
- No policy modification allowed
- No action dispatch allowed
- Enforced at interface level

---

## Error Handling

### Error 1: Missing Advisory Flag

**Response:**
- Reject output
- Terminate AI component
- Revoke AI component identity
- Audit log entry
- Human notification

### Error 2: False Advisory Flag

**Response:**
- Reject output
- Terminate AI component
- Revoke AI component identity
- Audit log entry
- Human notification

### Error 3: Enforcement Attempt

**Response:**
- Reject operation
- Terminate AI component
- Revoke AI component identity
- Audit log entry
- Human notification
