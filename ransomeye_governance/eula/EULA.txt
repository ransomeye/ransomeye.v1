You are now BUILDING RansomEye Phase 1 from scratch.

This is NOT an audit.
This is a FULL IMPLEMENTATION task.

Phase:
- Phase 1 — Program Governance, Military-Grade Foundations & Global Constraints

Authoritative reference:
- Master 21-Dec-2025 specification
- Phase 1 prompt ONLY
- No other phase may be referenced as a dependency

Environment root:
- /home/ransomeye/rebuild/
- Phase path MUST be:
  /home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_governance/

ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

- No assumptions
- No placeholders
- No TODOs
- No “future phase will handle this”
- No reuse of existing code unless it EXACTLY matches Phase 1 spec
- Everything must FAIL-CLOSED
- Everything must be enforceable by code, not documentation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TASKS (ALL REQUIRED)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. CREATE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE (EXACT)

Create the complete Phase 1 directory structure exactly as defined in the spec, including:
- governance/
- eula/
- ci/
- tooling/
- env/
- docs/
- tests/

Paths must match EXACTLY.

2. GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS (MANDATORY)

Create ALL required governance documents, including but not limited to:
- LICENSE_POLICY.md
- THIRD_PARTY_POLICY.md
- SECURITY_POLICY.md
- AI_DAY1_READINESS.md
- SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY.md
- CONTRIBUTION_RULES.md

These are NOT placeholders.
They must contain enforceable rules referenced by tooling and CI.

3. EULA ENFORCEMENT (CRITICAL)

- Create EULA.txt at:
  /home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_governance/eula/EULA.txt
- File MUST exist even if empty
- Implement enforcement logic so that:
  - Installation or startup FAILS if EULA acceptance is missing
  - Acceptance is logged and auditable

4. CI ENFORCEMENT (HARD BLOCKERS)

Create ALL required CI jobs in:
- ransomeye_governance/ci/

Including:
- license_scan.yml
- header_enforcement.yml
- secret_scan.yml
- provenance.yml
- artifact_signing.yml

Each CI job MUST:
- Fail the pipeline on violation
- Explicitly block GPL / AGPL / SSPL
- Enforce header presence
- Enforce secret absence

5. TOOLING (EXECUTABLE, NOT DUMMY)

Implement ALL required validators in:
- ransomeye_governance/tooling/

Including:
- license_validator.py
- header_validator.py
- secret_validator.py
- provenance_generator.py
- artifact_signer.py

Each tool MUST:
- Be runnable
- Be referenced by CI
- Fail loudly and deterministically

6. ENV-ONLY CONFIGURATION ENFORCEMENT

- Remove ALL hardcoded secrets and defaults
- Implement runtime ENV validation
- Missing required ENV variable MUST:
  - Abort startup
  - Emit explicit error
- Unknown ENV variable MUST:
  - Abort startup

7. AI DAY-1 READINESS ENFORCEMENT (PHASE-1 LEVEL)

Implement Phase-1 enforcement that:
- FAILS if baseline AI artifacts are missing
- FAILS if AI attempts to start without signed baseline
- Includes tests that prove this behavior

Note:
This phase DOES NOT train AI.
It ENFORCES that AI CANNOT START EMPTY.

8. TESTS (MANDATORY)

Create ALL Phase-1 tests in:
- ransomeye_governance/tests/

Including:
- license_violation_tests
- header_violation_tests
- secret_violation_tests
- ai_baseline_presence_tests

Tests must be runnable and must FAIL on violation.

9. FILE HEADERS (ABSOLUTE)

Every file created MUST start with the mandatory header:
- Path
- Author
- Purpose

No exceptions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DELIVERABLES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After implementation, you MUST:

- Run all Phase-1 tests
- Run all validators
- Show CI config file paths
- Show directory tree
- Provide command outputs

Finally, provide a clear verdict:
- “Phase 1 implementation complete and ready for audit”

Do NOT proceed to any other phase.
Do NOT touch Phase 2+.
Focus ONLY on Phase 1.
