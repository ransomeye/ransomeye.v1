Below are **MILITARY-GRADE RED-TEAM PLAYBOOKS** for **RansomEye**, aligned with **all 12 phases**, **zero-assumption rules**, **Day-1 readiness**, and **court-defensible validation**.

These playbooks are **not pentest checklists**.
They are **adversarial campaign simulations** designed to **break architecture, trust, determinism, and safety guarantees**.

All playbooks assume the attacker is **skilled, patient, and evasive**.

# 🔴 RANSOMEYE — RED-TEAM PLAYBOOKS

## (Authoritative Adversarial Validation Set)

---

## 🎯 RED-TEAM OBJECTIVES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Each playbook MUST attempt to:

1. Bypass trust boundaries
2. Cause false enforcement
3. Suppress real detection
4. Break determinism
5. Poison intelligence
6. Exploit scale (50k+ endpoints)
7. Force fail-open behavior

**Success is defined as:**
RansomEye **detects, resists, fails closed, logs, and recovers**.
