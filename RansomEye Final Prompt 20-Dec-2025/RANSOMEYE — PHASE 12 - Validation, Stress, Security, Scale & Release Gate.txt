# 🧪 RANSOMEYE — PHASE 12

## Validation, Stress, Security, Scale & Release Gate

### **(AUTHORITATIVE MASTER PROMPT – PHASE 12 | FINAL)**

**Environment Root:** `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/`
**Phase Folder:** `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_validation/`

---

## CONTEXT (NO COMPROMISE)

This phase decides whether **RansomEye is releasable**.

Nothing ships unless **every prior phase is proven** to:

* Behave deterministically
* Fail closed
* Scale to enterprise extremes
* Remain safe under attack
* Defend from **Day 1** with **fully trained AI/ML/LLM**

This is not QA.
This is **operational proof under hostile conditions**.

---

## 🚨 GLOBAL RULES (RE-ENFORCED)

All rules from **Phase 1–11** apply unchanged.

Additional Phase-12 rules are **hard enforcement**.

---

## 🎯 PHASE 12 OBJECTIVE

Build a **comprehensive, automated validation and stress framework** that:

1. Verifies **every phase contract**
2. Stress-tests **50,000+ endpoints**
3. Validates **40+ Gbps DPI throughput**
4. Proves **determinism and fail-closed behavior**
5. Validates **AI/ML/LLM Day-1 readiness**
6. Simulates **active attacker behavior**
7. Produces **release certification artifacts**

---

## 📦 RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARIES (STRICT)

### MUST DO

* End-to-end validation
* Adversarial testing
* Load and stress testing
* Fault injection
* Determinism verification
* Security posture validation
* Produce signed release reports

### MUST NEVER DO

* Modify production code
* Relax constraints
* Skip failing tests
* Mask nondeterminism
* Disable safeguards

## 🔄 END-TO-END VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

You MUST validate complete flows:

1. DPI / Agents → Ingestion
2. Ingestion → Core Correlation
3. Core → Policy Engine
4. Policy → Dispatcher
5. Dispatcher → Stand-alone Agents
6. Evidence → Reporting
7. AI → Analyst only (no authority)

Every flow must be:

* Signed
* Audited
* Deterministic

---

## 📈 SCALE & STRESS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST prove:

* **50,000+ endpoints** simulated concurrently
* Sustained DPI ingest at **40+ Gbps**
* Backpressure correctness
* Bounded memory usage
* No global lock collapse
* Swap behavior correct (Core & DPI only)

Failure anywhere → **FAIL RELEASE**

---

## 🔐 SECURITY & ADVERSARIAL TESTING

You MUST simulate:

* Identity spoofing
* Signature forgery
* Replay attacks
* Policy tampering
* Agent compromise
* AI poisoning attempts

Expected behavior:

* Detection
* Rejection
* Audit
* No enforcement without authority

---

## 🧠 AI / ML / LLM DAY-1 VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

You MUST prove:

* Baseline models exist and load
* SHAP generated for every inference
* LLM operates offline
* No inference without explainability
* No AI influence on enforcement
* No cold-start conditions

AI subsystem failure must:

* Disable AI only
* Leave Core operational

---

## 🔁 DETERMINISM & FAIL-CLOSED

You MUST prove:

* Identical inputs → identical outputs
* Order variance handled explicitly
* No race-condition detection drift
* Any ambiguity → NO ACTION
* Any verification failure → FAIL CLOSED

---

## 💥 FAULT INJECTION (MANDATORY)

Inject and validate behavior for:

* Network partitions
* Disk exhaustion
* CPU starvation
* Memory pressure
* Swap removal (Core/DPI)
* Partial upgrades
* Power loss mid-operation

System must:

* Remain safe
* Recover deterministically
* Preserve audit trails

---

## 📜 RELEASE ARTIFACTS (MANDATORY)

You MUST produce:

* **Release Certificate** (signed)
* **Coverage Report**
* **Risk Register**
* **Known Limitations**
* **Reproducibility Instructions**

No release without signed artifacts.

---

## 🛑 RELEASE FAILURE CONDITIONS (ABSOLUTE)

Phase 12 FAILS if:

* Any phase violates contracts
* Any nondeterminism exists
* AI is not Day-1 ready
* Enforcement occurs on ambiguity
* Swap rules are violated
* GPL contamination exists
* EULA enforcement is bypassable

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

Treat Phase 12 as:

* A **weapons test range**
* A **courtroom rehearsal**
* A **battlefield simulation**

Only if Phase 12 passes **completely** is RansomEye considered:

> **MILITARY-GRADE, ENTERPRISE-READY, DAY-1 DEFENSIVE**

**BUILD PHASE 12 COMPLETELY, EXPLICITLY, AND WITHOUT ASSUMPTIONS.**

---

## ✅ END OF BUILD PLAN

You now have a **full, end-to-end, phase-wise, military-grade build plan**.
