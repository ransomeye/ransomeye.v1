# 🧠 RANSOMEYE – PHASE 8

## LLM Summarization, RAG & SOC Copilot (Advisory Only)

### **(PROMPT NUMBER 8 OF 12)**

**MASTER PROMPT – CURSOR EXECUTION**

---

## CONTEXT (STRICTLY ADVISORY ROLE)

You are building the **LLM-based Summarization and SOC Copilot layer** for RansomEye.

This component exists **only to assist humans**.
It must **never influence enforcement, policy evaluation, or automated response**.

Any violation here introduces:

* Legal risk
* Safety risk
* Trust-model collapse

This phase must be **hard-isolated** from the Core decision path.

---

## 🚨 ABSOLUTE LANGUAGE RULES

### ✅ ALLOWED LANGUAGES

* **Python (MANDATORY for LLM orchestration)**
* **Rust (ONLY for adapters, verification, and isolation wrappers)**

### ❌ FORBIDDEN LANGUAGES

* Java
* Go
* NodeJS
* Any cloud-only SDK
* Any external API–dependent LLM

➡️ LLMs must run **locally / offline**.

---

## 🚫 LICENSE RULES (STRICT)

Allowed:

* MIT
* BSD
* Apache 2.0

BANNED:

* GPL / AGPL / SSPL
* Proprietary cloud LLM SDKs
* Unknown-license models or tokenizers

Models must be:

* Locally hosted
* Redistributable
* License-reviewed

---

## 🎯 PHASE 8 OBJECTIVE

Build a **read-only, offline, explainable SOC Copilot** that:

1. Summarizes incidents
2. Explains correlation and policy decisions
3. Answers analyst questions using RAG
4. Produces **human-readable narratives**
5. Never produces commands or actions

---

## 📦 SOC COPILOT RESPONSIBILITIES (STRICT)

### MUST DO

* Contextual summarization
* Natural-language explanation
* Evidence referencing
* Analyst Q&A (read-only)
* Confidence and uncertainty disclosure

### MUST NEVER DO

* Trigger actions
* Modify state
* Suggest enforcement
* Bypass policy
* Learn autonomously

```

## 🧠 LLM MODEL CONSTRAINTS

You MUST:

* Use local models only (e.g., llama.cpp–based)
* Verify model checksum and signature
* Pin model versions
* Document license for every model

Model load failure = **Copilot disabled**, not system failure.

---

## 📚 RAG (RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION)

You MUST define:

* Allowed document sources:

  * Correlation explanations
  * Policy decisions
  * Audit logs
  * Runbooks
* Indexing strategy
* Retrieval limits
* Context window enforcement

No raw telemetry allowed.

---

## 🔐 GUARDRAILS & SAFETY (MANDATORY)

You MUST enforce:

* Prompt signing
* Prompt immutability
* Output sanitization
* Hallucination detection
* Explicit uncertainty disclosure

LLM output must:

* Reference evidence IDs
* Indicate confidence
* Never fabricate facts

---

## 🔀 CORE ↔ LLM INTERACTION (STRICT)

* One-way, read-only
* LLM cannot call Core APIs that mutate state
* LLM cannot see secrets
* LLM cannot access raw events

---

## 💥 FAILURE MODES (MANDATORY)

Define behavior for:

* Model missing
* Model signature invalid
* Prompt tampered
* RAG index corrupted
* Hallucination detected

Failures must:

* Be logged
* Be visible to SOC
* Never affect enforcement

---

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS

You MUST include:

* Hallucination tests
* Prompt integrity tests
* Read-only enforcement tests
* Regression tests
* Offline operation tests

---

## 📤 EXPECTED OUTPUT

You must output:

1. SOC Copilot architecture
2. Folder structure explanation
3. Prompt governance model
4. RAG pipeline design
5. Guardrail enforcement
6. Failure handling matrix
7. Test strategy

---

## 🛑 FAILURE CONDITIONS

Your output is INVALID if:

* LLM can influence enforcement
* External APIs are used
* Prompts are mutable at runtime
* Model licenses are unclear
* Read-only boundary is violated

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

Treat the LLM as:

* A junior analyst assistant
* Not an authority
* Not a decision-maker

Design it so:

* Humans stay in control
* Evidence remains verifiable
* Outputs remain defensible

**BUILD PHASE 8 COMPLETELY, ISOLATED, AND SAFE.**
