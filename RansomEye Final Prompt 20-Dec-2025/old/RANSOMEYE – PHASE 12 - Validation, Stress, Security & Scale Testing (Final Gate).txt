# 🧪 RANSOMEYE – PHASE 12

## Validation, Stress, Security & Scale Testing (Final Gate)

### **(PROMPT NUMBER 12 OF 12)**

**MASTER PROMPT – CURSOR EXECUTION**

---

## CONTEXT (FINAL QUALITY GATE)

You are executing the **final validation phase** of RansomEye.

This phase is the **last and non-negotiable gate** before RansomEye can be:

* Released
* Sold
* Deployed
* Certified

If this phase is weak:

* All previous work is untrustworthy
* Scale claims are invalid
* Security guarantees collapse

**Nothing passes Phase 12 unless it is proven.**

---

## 🚨 GLOBAL HARD RULES (RE-ENFORCED)

These rules apply to **all validation activities**:

* No sample or production data
* Synthetic data only
* Deterministic test runs
* ENV-only configuration
* Mandatory file headers
* No GPL / AGPL / unknown licenses
* No internet dependency
* Fail-closed on test failure

---

## 🎯 PHASE 12 OBJECTIVE

Build a **comprehensive, repeatable, deterministic validation framework** that proves:

1. Functional correctness
2. Security guarantees
3. Performance at scale
4. Failure safety
5. Upgrade safety
6. License compliance

This phase must provide **evidence**, not confidence.

---

## 📦 VALIDATION SCOPE (MANDATORY)

You MUST validate **every major subsystem**:

* DPI Probe (40+ Gbps)
* Ingestion & Backpressure
* Core Correlation Engine
* Policy Engine
* AI / ML Layer
* LLM SOC Copilot
* Linux Agent
* Windows Agent
* Reporting & Forensics
* Installer & Upgrade

No subsystem is exempt.

## 🧠 VALIDATION FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS

You MUST implement:

* Scenario-driven testing
* Deterministic execution
* Explicit pass/fail assertions
* Metrics collection
* Signed validation reports

No manual testing allowed.

---

## ⚙️ SCALE & PERFORMANCE VALIDATION

You MUST prove:

* DPI sustains 40+ Gbps (synthetic)
* No packet loss beyond defined thresholds
* Ingestion backpressure works
* Correlation scales to 50k+ entities
* Memory remains bounded
* CPU scales linearly

Claims without evidence = **FAIL**

---

## 🔐 SECURITY VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

You MUST test:

* Identity spoofing
* Replay attacks
* Policy tampering
* Model tampering
* Unsigned artifact injection
* Privilege downgrade scenarios

All attacks must be **detected and blocked**.

---

## 💥 FAILURE INJECTION TESTING

You MUST inject:

* Process crashes
* Network loss
* Disk exhaustion
* Memory pressure
* Partial component failure

System must:

* Fail safely
* Recover deterministically
* Preserve evidence

---

## 🔄 UPGRADE & ROLLBACK VALIDATION

You MUST validate:

* Rolling upgrades
* Mixed-version compatibility
* Rollback correctness
* State migration safety

Upgrade failures must be **reversible**.

---

## 📊 REPORTING & EVIDENCE (MANDATORY)

Each validation run MUST produce:

* Signed validation report
* Pass/fail matrix
* Performance metrics
* Failure analysis
* Reproduction instructions

Reports must be:

* Verifiable
* Immutable
* Audit-ready

---

## 🧪 TESTING CONSTRAINTS

* Synthetic data only
* No randomness without seed control
* No internet access
* No human intervention

---

## 📤 EXPECTED OUTPUT

You must output:

1. Validation framework architecture
2. Folder structure explanation
3. Scenario definitions
4. Assertion model
5. Performance proof methodology
6. Security test coverage
7. Failure analysis
8. Acceptance criteria

---

## 🛑 FAILURE CONDITIONS

Your output is INVALID if:

* Any subsystem is untested
* Any test is non-deterministic
* Any claim lacks evidence
* Failures are ignored
* Reports are unsigned

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

This phase is the **gatekeeper of truth**.

If Phase 12 passes:

* RansomEye is real
* RansomEye is defensible
* RansomEye is sellable

If it fails:

* Everything before it is irrelevant

**BUILD PHASE 12 COMPLETELY, RIGOROUSLY, AND WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS.**
