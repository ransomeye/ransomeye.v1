# 📊 RANSOMEYE — PHASE 10

## Reporting, Forensics, Evidence Preservation & Audit Outputs

### **(AUTHORITATIVE MASTER PROMPT – PHASE 10)**

**Environment Root:** `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/`
**Phase Folder:** `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_reporting/`

---

## CONTEXT (LEGAL & FORENSIC GRADE)

This phase produces **evidence**, not dashboards.

All outputs from this phase may be:

* Used in internal incident response
* Presented to auditors
* Shared with regulators
* Submitted in legal proceedings

Therefore:

* **Nothing may be altered**
* **Nothing may be inferred**
* **Nothing may be hidden**
* **Everything must be verifiable**

If this phase is weak, **RansomEye is legally indefensible**.

---

## 🚨 GLOBAL RULES (RE-ENFORCED)

All rules from **Phase 1–9C** apply unchanged.

Additional Phase-10 rules below are **hard enforcement**.

---

## 🎯 PHASE 10 OBJECTIVE

Build an **audit-grade, forensically sound reporting and evidence system** that:

1. Produces **immutable evidence artifacts**
2. Preserves full chain-of-custody
3. Supports **PDF, HTML, CSV**
4. Cryptographically signs every report
5. Guarantees reproducibility
6. Exposes explainability artifacts (from Phase 8)
7. Never mutates original detection data

---

## 📦 RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARIES (STRICT)

### MUST DO

* Snapshot validated outputs only
* Generate cryptographic hashes at capture time
* Sign evidence and reports
* Maintain chain-of-custody logs
* Support independent verification
* Export in required formats

### MUST NEVER DO

* Re-run detection logic
* Modify evidence post-capture
* Hide uncertainty or confidence
* Aggregate beyond source meaning
* Allow mutable storage

---

## 🔐 CHAIN OF CUSTODY (MANDATORY)

You MUST implement:

* Evidence ID generation
* Capture timestamps (monotonic + wall-clock)
* Hash-at-capture
* Immutable custody log entries
* Signed custody transitions

Every access, export, or verification:

* Must append a custody record
* Must be signed
* Must be verifiable independently

---

## 📑 REPORT CONTENT (MANDATORY & FIXED)

Each report MUST include:

* Incident identifier
* Detection timeline
* Entities involved
* Kill-chain stages (from Phase 5)
* Policy decisions (from Phase 6)
* Enforcement directives & outcomes (Phase 7)
* AI explainability references (Phase 8)
* Confidence values
* Analyst annotations (clearly marked)
* Cryptographic hashes
* Verification instructions

No speculative language allowed.

---

## 📤 OUTPUT FORMAT RULES

### PDF

* Human-readable
* Signed
* Watermarked with Report ID
* Embedded hash summary

### HTML

* Self-contained
* Read-only
* Embedded verification metadata

### CSV

* Raw data only
* No interpretation
* Each row hash-referenced

---

## 🔀 DATA FLOW (STRICT & IMMUTABLE)

Define and enforce:

1. Input selection (validated only)
2. Evidence snapshot
3. Hash generation
4. Signature application
5. Format rendering
6. Output sealing
7. Verification workflow

At no point may data mutate.

---

## 💥 FAILURE MODES (MANDATORY)

Define explicit behavior for:

* Missing evidence
* Hash mismatch
* Signature failure
* Partial export
* Disk exhaustion

Any failure → **ABORT OUTPUT, PRESERVE ORIGINAL EVIDENCE**

---

## 🧪 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

You MUST include tests that:

* Prove immutability
* Detect tampering
* Validate cross-format parity
* Verify reproducibility
* Validate custody integrity

---

## 🛑 FAILURE CONDITIONS (HARD)

Phase 10 is INVALID if:

* Evidence can be modified
* Hashing is optional
* Reports are unsigned
* Formats diverge semantically
* Python mutates evidence

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

Treat Phase 10 outputs as:

* **Court-admissible artifacts**
* **Immutable truth records**
* **Externally verifiable proof**

If Phase 10 is weak, **RansomEye cannot be trusted beyond SOC dashboards**.

**BUILD PHASE 10 COMPLETELY, EXPLICITLY, AND WITHOUT ASSUMPTIONS.**
