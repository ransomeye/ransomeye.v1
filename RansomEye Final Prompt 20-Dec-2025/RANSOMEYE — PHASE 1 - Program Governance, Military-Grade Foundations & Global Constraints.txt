# 🧱 RANSOMEYE — PHASE 1

## Program Governance, Military-Grade Foundations & Global Constraints

### **(AUTHORITATIVE MASTER PROMPT – PHASE 1)**

**Environment Root:** `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/`
**Phase Folder:** `/home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_governance/`

---

## CONTEXT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You are building **RansomEye**, a:

* **Military-grade**
* **Enterprise-class**
* **Commercial, closed-source**
* **Zero-trust ransomware defense platform**
* **Production-ready from Day 1**

This system must be:

* Defensible in audits
* Survivable under attack
* Deterministic under failure
* Legally sellable
* Operational in air-gapped environments

**NO assumptions are allowed.**
**EVERY rule must be enforced by code, not documentation.**

---

## 🚨 ABSOLUTE GLOBAL RULES (APPLY TO ALL PHASES)

These rules are **binding for the entire project**.

### 1. Licensing (FAIL-CLOSED)

**Allowed ONLY**

* MIT
* BSD 2-Clause / 3-Clause
* Apache 2.0
* PSF
* CC0

**Conditionally allowed**

* LGPL → ONLY if dynamically linked and isolated

**BANNED (ABSOLUTE)**

* GPL v2 / v3
* AGPL
* SSPL
* Elastic License
* Unknown / custom licenses
* GPL rules, signatures, datasets, or content

➡️ **CI must block immediately on violation**

---

### 2. Programming Language Governance

| Layer             | Allowed Languages                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Governance / Core | **Rust only**                               |
| DPI Probe         | **Rust + C++ + eBPF only**                  |
| Linux Agent       | **Rust (C only if unavoidable)**            |
| Windows Agent     | **Rust + C++**                              |
| AI / ML / LLM     | **Python (isolated) + Rust/C++ extensions** |
| Installers        | **Rust + Shell (orchestrator only)**        |

**Python is FORBIDDEN on hot paths.**

---

### 3. Configuration & Secrets

* ENV-only configuration
* No defaults for secrets
* Missing / invalid ENV → **FAIL STARTUP**
* Unknown ENV variables → **FAIL STARTUP**

---

### 4. Mandatory File Headers (NO EXCEPTIONS)

Every file MUST start with:

```
# Path: <absolute repo path>
# Author: RansomEye Core Team
# Purpose: <explicit purpose>
```

Applies to:
`.rs .c .cpp .py .sh .yaml .json .toml .service`

---

### 5. Data & AI Rules (CRITICAL)

* NO sample data committed
* NO runtime learning without baseline
* **ALL AI / ML / LLM MUST BE PRE-TRAINED FROM DAY 1**
* Incremental learning allowed ONLY on top of baseline
* SHAP explainability is mandatory for every numeric inference

---

### 6. Cryptographic Trust

* Every artifact signed
* Every signature verified before use
* Verification failure → **BLOCK OPERATION**

---

## 🎯 PHASE 1 OBJECTIVE

Phase 1 establishes **global governance, trust, safety, and enforcement primitives** that **ALL other phases depend on**.

This phase defines:

* Legal safety
* Build safety
* Supply-chain safety
* AI readiness from Day 1
* Installation legal acceptance (EULA)
* Operational invariants

**No business logic is allowed in Phase 1.**

---

## 📁 PHASE 1 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Create exactly the following at:

```
/home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_governance/
```

```
ransomeye_governance/
├── governance/
│   ├── LICENSE_POLICY.md
│   ├── THIRD_PARTY_POLICY.md
│   ├── SECURITY_POLICY.md
│   ├── AI_DAY1_READINESS.md
│   ├── SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY.md
│   └── CONTRIBUTION_RULES.md
│

    ├── header_violation_tests.py

    └── ai_baseline_presence_tests.py
```

You MUST explain **why each directory exists** and **what it forbids**.

---

## 🧠 AI / ML / LLM — DAY-1 READINESS (MANDATORY FIX)

You MUST define a **Day-1 AI Baseline Doctrine**:

### REQUIRED CONCEPT:

**Signed Baseline Intelligence Pack**

Each RansomEye deployment MUST ship with:

* Pre-trained ransomware behavior models
* Pre-trained anomaly baselines
* Pre-trained confidence calibration
* Pre-generated SHAP reference distributions
* Pre-indexed LLM RAG corpus

Rules:

* AI MUST NOT start empty
* AI MUST NOT self-train without baseline
* AI output suppressed if baseline invalid

Document this fully in:

```
AI_DAY1_READINESS.md
```

---

## 📜 EULA ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY)

Rules:

* Installation MUST fail unless EULA is accepted
* EULA file path is fixed:

  ```
  /home/ransomeye/rebuild/ransomeye_governance/eula/EULA.txt
  ```
* Acceptance must be logged
* Acceptance must be auditable
* Acceptance must be explicit (no implicit install)

No EULA = **NO INSTALL**

---

## 🔐 SUPPLY-CHAIN SECURITY (MILITARY-GRADE)

You MUST define:

* Reproducible builds
* Build provenance
* SBOM generation
* Signed release manifests
* CI identity attestation

All documented in:

```
SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY.md
```

---

## 🧪 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (PHASE 1)

You MUST create tests that:

* Fail on GPL license
* Fail on missing AI baseline artifacts
* Fail on missing EULA file
* Fail on missing headers
* Fail on secret leakage

---

## 🛑 FAILURE CONDITIONS (HARD)

Phase 1 is INVALID if:

* Any GPL is tolerated
* AI baseline is optional
* EULA is not enforced
* Headers are optional
* Trust is implicit
* Anything “assumes later phases will fix it”

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION (ABSOLUTE)

Treat Phase 1 as:

* A legal contract
* A military compliance framework
* A zero-trust constitution

If Phase 1 is weak, **the entire platform is invalid**.

**BUILD PHASE 1 COMPLETELY, EXPLICITLY, AND WITHOUT ASSUMPTIONS.**
